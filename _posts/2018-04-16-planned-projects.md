#### Project Lilith
A code generation engine for the Lua language with the goal to
make building additional content dramatically easier. The developers
will be able to write files formatted similiar to Jinja templates,
that use CSVs as input. This will enable designers to add content
into the system with minimal developer input.

maps. Enabling two layers for maps, a base and an overlay, as well
as controllers for entity spawn points. Eventually a GUI will be 
developed to make the process even easier for designers.

#### Tale of Herrlof
Derived from Old Norse meaning "praise gained in war" this is planned
as the first game for the studio. The game will follow the story of
a viking (potentially MP) as they a left on an island to fend for 
themselves and battle the monsters of legend. Using fables the player
will be able to pick up on clues in the region while hunting the monster
in order to better prepare for the face-off. While focusing on Norse
mythology, expansions might come to include other cultures lore as 
hunting destinations.

#### Black Watch
A tactical bullet hell game giving homage to other tactical arcade
games such as SOCOM Navy Seals with the addition of a 3rd AI team
offering resistance to both teams. Planned game modes include 
Suppression, Demolition, Control Points, and Extraction.
