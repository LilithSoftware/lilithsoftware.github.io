We are an indie game studio dedicated to creating games 
for fun before profit, specializing in the bullet hell
genre. This blog will outline the development of the 
various projects.

Our studio makes heavy use of Love2D for all game projects,
and Aseprite for all art assets.

## Core Team:

#### Jordan (Kirogama) - Lead Developer:
In addition to his work at Lilith Software, Jordan works
professionally as a web developer with Ruby on Rails. He is
also the founder and sole developer for all games. In addition
to being a developer Jordan also contributes art to the studio.

#### Daniel (Fraydin) - Audio Composer:
Daniel joined Lilith Software as a hobbyist to provide art 
for the studio for his own reasons. In exchange the studio
has provided him with audio production tools to use.

## Bounty Hunters
The studio plans to use a network of artists and art bounties
to enable the artists to gain some side cash while providing
us with high quality work. (Referencing the Bug Bounty Programs
used by security teams)
